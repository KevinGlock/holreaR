Holistic Research with R
The holreaR package uses collapsibleTree to visualise research fields, topics, aspects, and subcategories, as well as, specific literature with a holistic approach to get a more intuitive perspective on it.
It is simple and intuitively designed with many comments on the code to use it without much R knowledge.
